Here are my pocketmine plugins i have made. These are simple, yet fun plugins i make. They function as new, helpful additions to your MCPE server! you may use them on your own Pocketmine server if you like! Just dont re-distribute them! Enjoy these plugins!

All are in PHP format.

Plugins are currently only for PocketMine API 12. I am trying to make them support Pocketmine 1.4. If you want to help convert them, pull a request!
